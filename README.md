# DV Employment Forecast

In *73-423 Forecasting for Economics and Business* (undergraduate course at Carnegie Mellon University), I studied modern methods for forecasting in economic and business applications. Topics covered include Bayesian, statistical, and online learning approaches to forecast construction and assessment, univariate and multivariate time series models, and algorithms. 

As a part of the final project, I considered various modeling approaches to forecast the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April 2019 release of the Unemployment Rate and change in Nonfarm Payroll Employment. 

The forecasting methodologies that are considered and implemeneted in my R-code include: 
- Autoregressive Models using Empirical Risk Minimization
- Vector Autoregressive Models including variables such as NASDAQ prices, US Retail Gas Prices, the Consumer Price Index, and the Federal Funds Rate
- Bayesian Methods, such as Autoregressive Models using Laplace Priors
- Machine Learning Approaches, such as Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting
